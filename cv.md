### About Me:


I’m 47. I work as leading engineer for television equipment.
I have great desire to change my life. I want to study and develop, to gain new knowledge's and skills and to try myself in something new, previously incomprehensible and mysterious for me.
It is important for me to maintain the feeling that all the most interesting things are yet to come. I often spend a lot of time doing what I'm interested in. I like frontend development for the opportunity to immediately see the fruits of their labor. I want to gain knowledge and skills that will be enough for employment in a new field of activity for me.


**My strength:**
* Responsible person
* Dedication to work
* Teamwork
* Life experience
* The desire to study
